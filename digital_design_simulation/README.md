# Simulation with Python and Verilog

This project demonstrates how to simulate Verilog and Python. It integrates Verilog code with Python for automation, running the simulation, and displaying results. The project uses **Icarus Verilog** for simulation and **Python** for interfacing and automation. The setup is flexible and can be customized to work with different Verilog files or formats.

## Usage

1. **Write the Verilog Code**: 
   Ensure that your Verilog module(s) and testbench are placed in the appropriate directory. You can modify the names of the files as needed, but the Python script must reference them correctly.

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python run_simulation.py
